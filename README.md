Welcome to my GitHub repository for the 7th Sem Internship 2024 @Manektech Solutions! This showcases the work done during the internship, including practical insights and hands-on experience with various modern technologies.

## üöÄ Introduction
**25th May 2024**  
**Project Planning and Requirements**  
On the first day of the internship, I had an orientation meeting to understand the project requirements. The goal was to develop a tailored website for a business, ensuring it met the client's specific needs. This involved extensive communication with the client to gather requirements and document them meticulously.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Week 1
**28th May 2024**  
**Initial Setup and Environment Configuration**  
The first week involved setting up the development environment. I installed all necessary software and tools, including React.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. Configuring the development environment properly was crucial for the smooth progress of the project.

**Day-by-Day Progress:**

**Day 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**  
I installed Node.js and React.js, ensuring that all dependencies were properly configured. This included setting up

the project structure and creating a basic React application to serve as the foundation for the website.

**Day 2: Creating Initial Components**
Started building the basic components for the website. This included the header, footer, and navigation bar. Ensuring these components were reusable and easy to maintain was a priority.

**Day 3: Implementing Routing**
Set up React Router to handle navigation between different pages of the website. This allowed for smooth transitions and a better user experience.

**Day 4: Designing the Home Page**
Developed the layout for the home page, incorporating client feedback to ensure it met their expectations. Focused on making it responsive and visually appealing.

Day 5: Connecting to a Backend API
Started integrating the frontend with a mock backend API to simulate data fetching. This was essential for testing the functionality of the website.

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Week 2**
**4th June 2024**
**Backend Development with Node.js**
The second week focused on backend development. I set up a Node.js server and created RESTful APIs to handle data operations. This involved creating endpoints for various CRUD operations and ensuring secure data handling practices.

Day-by-Day Progress:

**Day 1: Setting Up the Node.js Server**
Installed Express.js and set up the basic server structure. Created initial routes for the API and tested them using Postman.

**Day 2: Creating Database Schema**
Designed the database schema using MongoDB. This involved defining collections and setting up relationships between different data entities.

**Day 3: Implementing CRUD Operations**
Developed endpoints for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations. Ensured that each endpoint was thoroughly tested and validated.

**Day 4: Securing the API**
Implemented authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). This ensured that only authorized users could access certain endpoints.

**Day 5: Integrating Frontend and Backend**
Connected the React frontend with the Node.js backend. This involved making API calls from the frontend and displaying the data dynamically.
