Welcome to my GitHub repository for the 7th Sem Internship 2024 @Manektech Solutions! This showcases the work done during the internship, including practical insights and hands-on experience with various modern technologies.

## üöÄ Introduction
**25th May 2024**  
**Project Planning and Requirements**  
On the first day of the internship, I had an orientation meeting to understand the project requirements. The goal was to develop a tailored website for a business, ensuring it met the client's specific needs. This involved extensive communication with the client to gather requirements and document them meticulously.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Week 1
**28th May 2024**  
**Initial Setup and Environment Configuration**  
The first week involved setting up the development environment. I installed all necessary software and tools, including React.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. Configuring the development environment properly was crucial for the smooth progress of the project.

**Day-by-Day Progress:**

**Day 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**  
I installed Node.js and React.js, ensuring that all dependencies were properly configured. This included setting up

the project structure and creating a basic React application to serve as the foundation for the website.

**Day 2: Creating Initial Components**
Started building the basic components for the website. This included the header, footer, and navigation bar. Ensuring these components were reusable and easy to maintain was a priority.

**Day 3: Implementing Routing**
Set up React Router to handle navigation between different pages of the website. This allowed for smooth transitions and a better user experience.

**Day 4: Designing the Home Page**
Developed the layout for the home page, incorporating client feedback to ensure it met their expectations. Focused on making it responsive and visually appealing.

Day 5: Connecting to a Backend API
Started integrating the frontend with a mock backend API to simulate data fetching. This was essential for testing the functionality of the website.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Week 2
**4th June 2024**
**Backend Development with Node.js**
The second week focused on backend development. I set up a Node.js server and created RESTful APIs to handle data operations. This involved creating endpoints for various CRUD operations and ensuring secure data handling practices.

Day-by-Day Progress:

**Day 1: Setting Up the Node.js Server**
Installed Express.js and set up the basic server structure. Created initial routes for the API and tested them using Postman.

**Day 2: Creating Database Schema**
Designed the database schema using MongoDB. This involved defining collections and setting up relationships between different data entities.

**Day 3: Implementing CRUD Operations**
Developed endpoints for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations. Ensured that each endpoint was thoroughly tested and validated.

**Day 4: Securing the API**
Implemented authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). This ensured that only authorized users could access certain endpoints.

**Day 5: Integrating Frontend and Backend**
Connected the React frontend with the Node.js backend. This involved making API calls from the frontend and displaying the data dynamically.


## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Week 3
**11th June 2024**
**Advanced Frontend Development**
The third week was dedicated to enhancing the frontend with advanced features. This included state management using Redux, improving UI/UX, and ensuring the website was fully responsive.

Day-by-Day Progress:

**Day 1: Setting Up Redux**
Installed Redux and set up the global state management. This helped in managing the application state more efficiently.

**Day 2: Implementing Advanced UI Components**
Developed advanced UI components such as modals, forms, and data tables. Ensured these components were reusable and met the design specifications.

**Day 3: Enhancing User Experience**
Improved the user experience by adding animations and transitions. This made the website more interactive and engaging.

**Day 4: Making the Website Responsive**
Ensured that the website was fully responsive and worked well on different devices and screen sizes. This involved using CSS media queries and responsive design principles.

**Day 5: User Testing and Feedback**
Conducted user testing to gather feedback on the website's functionality and design. Made necessary adjustments based on the feedback received.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Week 4
**18th June 2024**
**Deployment on AWS**
The final week focused on deploying the website on AWS. This included setting up various AWS services, deploying the backend on EC2, and hosting the frontend on S3 and CloudFront.

Day-by-Day Progress:

**Day 1: Setting Up AWS Services**
Configured AWS services such as EC2 for backend deployment and S3 for frontend hosting. Created the necessary IAM roles and policies for secure access.

**Day 2: Deploying the Backend on EC2**
Deployed the Node.js backend on an EC2 instance. Ensured that the server was properly configured and secured.

**Day 3: Hosting the Frontend on S3 and CloudFront**
Uploaded the React frontend to an S3 bucket and set up CloudFront for content delivery. This ensured that the website was fast and accessible from anywhere.

**Day 4: Configuring Security and Monitoring**
Implemented security best practices such as enabling HTTPS, setting up security groups, and configuring CloudWatch for monitoring.

**Day 5: Final Testing and Launch**
Conducted final testing to ensure everything was working as expected. Launched the website and monitored its performance.

**Conclusion**
This internship was an enriching experience that provided me with valuable insights and practical knowledge in web development and deployment. From understanding client requirements and planning the project to developing with React.js, Node.js, and deploying on AWS, every step was a learning opportunity. This journey has equipped me with the skills and confidence to tackle future projects and continue my growth as a developer.
